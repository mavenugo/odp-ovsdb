DIRECTORY ORGANIZATION
======================

- commons/parent: contains the parent pom.xml for all ovsdb projects.
- ovsdb: contains the ovsdb SB plugin
- neutron: contains the ODL OVSDB neutron plugin that handles the OpenStack integration
- distribution/opendaylight: will build a working controller distribution
  based on the controller + ovsdb modules

HOW TO BUILD
============

In order to build it's required to have JDK 1.7+ and Maven 3+, to get
a build going it's needed to execute the following command from the root directory:

mvn clean install

HOW TO RUN
============

Upon successful completion of a build

cd distribution/opendaylight/target/distribution.ovsdb-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight/
./run.sh

HOW TO MAKE SURE OVSDB is OPERATIONAL
=====================================

On the Running shell of the controller, from the osgi> command prompt, type "ss ovsdb" and that
should result in ACTIVE ovsdb bundles.

osgi> ss ovsdb
"Framework is launched."

HOW TO USE IT
=============

Sample POSTMAN script : https://www.getpostman.com/collections/e89c172d759c87ec944a

1. Use the "Connect Controller to OVSDB Switch" script to connect the Controller to your switch that supports hardware-vtep schema
   -> Change the Ip-address & Port-number based on your switch configurations. And change the Connection-Name to your taste.
   -> In this sample POSTMAN collection, the Connection-Name is "HOST1" and IP-address 216.129.126.126 & Port 6640

2. As you can see, these REST-APIs are for the OpenVSwitchd schema and not for the hardware_vtep schema.
   -> All you have to do is to change the table names in the REST-API and update the JSON that fits the hardware_vtep schema.
     For example : List all Bridge => http://localhost:8080/ovsdb/nb/v2/node/OVS/HOST1/tables/bridge/rows
     You can change it to List all Physical_Switch => http://localhost:8080/ovsdb/nb/v2/node/OVS/HOST1/tables/Physical_Switch/rows
